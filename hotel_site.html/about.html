                <p>Fantastic meals! Pleasantly surprised:) Our stay at the budapest hotel was excellent. We stayed in the ground floor and the views
                    and sounds from the garden was splendid! Beyond relaxing atmosphere of the hotel, the next best part was the fantastic service at the 
                    reception and thay gave us a very generous gift before leaving. The staff was very attentive, professional, and friendlyüòã.

                <p>This is my second time staying here. Last year we stayed here to celebrate our anniversary and we LOVED IT. 
                    We agreed that every year,to celebrate our anniversary, we will be back to the same hotel. The smell of 
                    lavender everywhere you go is so relaxing especially if you live in a busy city as Surat. The quality
                    or the service provided is worth every bills paid for.
